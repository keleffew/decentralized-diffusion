Stable Diffusion is a cutting-edge text-to-image and image-to-image diffusion model.

Artificial intelligence text-to-image tools like Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and Dalle2 are rapidly unlocking new possibilities for memes, marketing, and predictive learning for advertising.  

Stable Diffusion was officially released into beta on August 22 as an open-source alternative to Dalle-2.  Because itâ€™s training parameters are open-source, Stable Diffusion, anyone can access and play around with the weights used to train the machine learning model.  Stable Diffusion does not contain the restrictions on political or sensitive content like Dalle2 does.

As such, these open-source models are especially well suited for web3-based decentralized cloud storage models, like Storj DCS.

In this developer walkthrough, we will utilize this cutting edge AI tool to pull an image from a bucket on the Decentralized Cloud, transform/diffuse it, and upload the result back to a new bucket.

The weights, model card and code for the Stable Diffusion model can be viewed here:  https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion.

This code will walk you through the process of interacting with stable diffusion and the decentralized cloud.
